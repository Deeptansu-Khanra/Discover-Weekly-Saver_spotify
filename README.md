Discover Weekly Saver for Spotify

This is a very simple python script I had made. To give you an overview of the project let me tell you 
I am a huge spotify user. I use it regularly a lot and in my used cases I used to listen to the spotify discover weekly.
But unfortunately it refreshes every week so everytime the playlist is lost. I saw this problem and decided that I should 
automate it with such a program which runs on a weekly basis and copies my discover weekly into a new playlist with the date
on it.
So I searched a lot on how to use spotify web api and get the access token and automate it by creating a new playlist. Spotify
Developer page had helped me a lot with the code to write this script.

I had finally used the Task Scheduler on Windows 10 to run the program automatically every monday and hence I get the 
Discover Weekly Playlist saved every week.
